# MatchX X2E Reference Sensor



## Introduction

MatchX X2E Reference Design is a universal platform to help you start your custom X2E application. It is completely open source so you can use it as a starting point for development and testing of your custom LPWAN sensor. It provides all hardware and software features to kickstart your development including LoRa (SubGHz and 2.4GHz) radios, set of sensors and GPS receiver. It is built around the ESP32-S3 module and has a friendly Arduino-compatible form factor.
